Messenger App using React and Firebase

The project that I always wanted to do and understand! 

## 🧐 What can we do:
1. You can login / register 
2. You can add your friend by his 'display' name in 'find an user' input field
3. While chating, you can send: Text, Image or Emoji (or all together) 
4. You can add 👍 Like reaction when you hover over your friend's message!
5. Adding text, image, reaction is immidiate for both users!
6. Friends panel shows in order so the highest friend is our last chat that we have or he was the last person that send something for us

## 🕵 What technologies were used: 
- React 
- Firebase for Authentication, Firestore, and Storage (Awesome stuff)
- SCSS 
- Font Awesome for cool svg icons 

### 🪲 Bugs 
- There are some situations, where we cannot upload image on chat (Something is happening with firebase currently) 

## Below are some images that shows all the functionality for this app
